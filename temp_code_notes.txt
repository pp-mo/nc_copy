MORE To-dos:
============

NcObj rename to NcElement ?
    NetCDF datamodel description call these 'components'
    --but the word is not repeated ??
    https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/data_model.html
    (( yes, it is in the "NetCDF User's Guide"))

Variables data access:
    Variable indexing reflects to the NetCDF4 underlying, allows getting
        data from variable (see 'usecase_code_ideas.txt')
    - also support data = ndarray/maskedarray
    - also need writing to it?
    - remove from var.dimensions when indexing removes data dimension ?

File i/o:
    review, rewrite, write tests

Documentation:
    Various functions in ncobj.grouping need proper explanations.

Usecase examples:
    demo to point out automatic re-creation of dimensions etc when copying
    demo to point out *problems* of automatic dimension creation/matching ??


BUGS + CHANGES
==============
* Variable.dimensions can't be accessed by name, only by index
    * that's sort-of ok, as it can occur more than once ?
    * in principle, at present, could even be two different dims of same name
    (if not finalised)
        * (see "repeated dim" below)
    * provide a method, or consider implementing a specialist container type

* ==!!!== Variable.dimensions.append does not enforce a detached_copy()
    * consider implementing a specialist container type instead of the list ?
    * (NEWER) possibly doesn't matter, if we only ever use it as data ??

* review str() methods -- could usefully do more like ncdump -ch
    * probably need a short form in str(), then separate call e.g. dump(), pp()

* nc_dataset.read should choke on user datatypes.
* nc_dataset.read should use setitem_reference throughout (not copying)

* add tests for dimensions special cases:
    * variable's list of dims can have a repeated dim
    * dim-names scope holes (inner overrides outer)

possible alternative create-defs-locally:
    def localise(group):
        for subgroup in group.groups:
            localise(subgroup)
        complete(group)
    * or maybe just document as an idea ?

MOTIVATION + USECASE IDEAS
    see - http://marqh.github.io/ncContainers/build/html/index.html

* Dimensions length inference from data shape (prototyped, not yet working).
* decent docstrings for all the public API
* version string, releases, tags + 'release notes' type info (somewhere?)
