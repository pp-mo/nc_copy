Implement basic real file i/o (nearly ready now)

Support for user types, along the lines of exiting Dimensions
    compound (aka structures)
    vlen (aka ragged)

Probably need to introduce some COARDS/CF concepts
    but maybe in separate 'utils' space ?

Use Biggus
    support streamed operations

Consider any relevance of wider data-access models
    OpenDAP
    (unidata) Common Data Model  (not sure how wide acceptance/relevance?)

Allow for efficient modifications in-existing-file.
