Implement basic real file i/o (nearly ready now)

Support for user types, along the lines of exiting Dimensions
    compound (aka structures)
    vlen (aka ragged)

Consistency for dimensions and lengths
    Check functions to test dimensions against variable.data shapes
    Variables referencing an unlimited dimension may have different actual
        lengths, therefore need separate dimension definitions (somehow)
        - this will be common when concatenating (otherwise) compatible inputs

Probably need to introduce some COARDS/CF concepts
    but maybe in separate 'utils' space ?

Use Biggus
    support streamed operations

Consider any relevance of wider data-access models
    OpenDAP
    (unidata) Common Data Model  (not sure how wide acceptance/relevance?)

Allow for efficient modifications in-existing-file.
